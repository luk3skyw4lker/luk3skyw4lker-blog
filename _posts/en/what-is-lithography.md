title: 'What is lithography?'
excerpt: 'Did you ever thought about how processors are made? Or how does it work inside? Today I will try to explain a little of these topics for you and speak about lithography, which is one of the concepts present in the making of all CPUs today.'

## Introduction to Processors History

A processor, aka CPU (Central Processing Unit), is essentially a electronic circuit capable of executing the instructions that are contained inside a **program**, it works like an automatic **abacus**, which means that the type of number system affects how it works. It performs some operations such as input/output (I/O) operations, basic arithmetic, logics, controlling instructions specified by the program. It also interacts with another parts of the computer, such as RAM, non-volatile memory devices, motherboard chipsets and another specialized processors such as GPUs (Graphic Processing Unit).

Starting from the early 50s, each computer design was completely unique, if you wrote a program for a specific machine, the same program wouldn't ever run in another one, even if it was another computer from the same company. This freedom at the time was very important, because the designers were very constrained by the electronic's cost and the best organization for a computer was still being explored, there was also important features that were introduced at the time: **index registers**, a **return address**, **immediate operands** and **detecting invalid operators**. As said earlier, the type of number system affects how a computer works (this is still true for today), so in the early 50s most of the computers used the decimal system and were build for specific numerical processing tasks, which means that their mathematical functions worked at the base-10 instead of base-2 as it is today, also these weren't simply binary coded decimals, some machines had **ten vaccuum tubes** per digit for each processor register.
